ðŸŽ’Calculator Challenge:

### Background:

Creating reusable components which we can use in different parts of our application can give us a big benefit to keep our functionality and styling consistent within our application and can increase the speed of developement. Therefore it is important to understand how we can create components and modify them with props.

### Your mission:

Build a calculator from scratch like this: https://vs7w3.csb.app/. The goal for of this challenge is to build reusable components, passing date down up and through components and to handle events. Focus on the functionality not on the styles when building your calculator. It does not have to look the same.

Minimum:

Rebuild the user interface of the calculator and create a reusable button component.
Add the input functionality. If a user presses one of the three button with a number or the "." in it, then update the nuber on the screen.
Add the functionality of clear "C", delete "DEL" and percentage "%". When pressing "C" the calculator is cleared and reset to its initial state. When presseing "DEL" the last number which has been input is removed from the input. When pressing "%", then one percent of the current number in the display should be returned (e.g. divide by 100).
Bonus Task (recommended, not essential):

Add the logic for the operations of addition, subbtraction, multiplication and division. It can take a little time to get around how the whole thing should work. To understand the logic behind a calculator it can be of benefit to google for the state machine of an calculator (keyword: pending operation).

### The way of grading:

You need to use a reusable component which can be modified within project.
It must be possible to enter numbers and the functionality of clear, delete and percentage.
It does not have to look the same or event pretty to get a good mark. The goal is to understand the how to use react to build a component, not how to write beauiful CSS .
Bonus Points: For implementing the
