ðŸŽ’Calculator Challenge:

### Background:

In react we like to build components which we can then stick together. Tabs to switch between content is a component which can be found used in many applications. Let's build one ourselves :).

### Your mission:

Build a a tab component like this https://bwir2.csb.app/. It hsould indicate which tab is currently active by changing the background color of the active tab. When a tab is active the content of that tab is displayed.

### The way of grading:

Does a tab become active when clicking on it? Does the content of the tab panel change when the active panel changes?

### Restrictions:

Use React Components and the useState hook to complete this challenge. Do not use any other hooks provided other than the useSate hook. Use the provided api int the `Tabs.jsx` for your Tab Component.
