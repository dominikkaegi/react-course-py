ðŸŽ’Calculator Challenge:

### Background:

Sometime when we update a lot of different states within our application it can be hard to keep oversight when we change what kind of state. React gives use a way to handle more complex state changes with the useReducer hook. Let's explore how to keep state changes together.

### Your mission:

Rebuild the calculator we built in the first calculcator challenge with the useReducer hook. Move the logic for state updates into the reducer to clear up your UI from app logic.

### The way of grading:

Have you moved to logic concerning state changes towards the reducer?

### Restrictions:

Logic for state changes must be handled by using the useReducer hook.
